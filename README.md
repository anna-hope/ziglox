# ziglox (WIP)

This is my project to learn [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) by implementing the Lox bytecode
interpreter from [Crafting Interpreters.](https://craftinginterpreters.com)

I am working on this project as part of my Summer 2 2024 batch at the [Recurse Center.](https://recurse.com) There is a chance I will not be able to finish it if my interests or priorities change
during the batch.

I am brand new to Zig, and would appreciate any suggestions or feedback on code style, good patterns,
and anything else!

## Running the project

- Make sure you have Zig installed (or use this link to [get it](https://ziglang.org/download/))
- Then run

```sh
zig build run
```

## Running tests

```sh
zig build test
```
